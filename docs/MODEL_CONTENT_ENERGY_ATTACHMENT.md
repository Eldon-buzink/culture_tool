## 6. Decision Compass Model

### 6.1 Model Overview

**Purpose**: Help users understand how they make decisions—their natural approach, what influences them, and how to make decisions with more confidence.

**Selection options that lead here:**
- "How do I make decisions? / Decide with confidence"

**Key insights to surface:**
- Decision-making style (head vs. heart, quick vs. deliberate, risk-taker vs. cautious)

### 6.3 Insight Rules (Progressive Reveal Logic)

**During assessment (after question 4-5):**
- If clear pattern emerges (e.g., consistently choosing logic), show:
  - "We're noticing something: it looks like you might rely on [pattern] when making decisions. Want to keep going to understand your decision style?"

**After question 9 (assessment complete):**
- Calculate decision style:
  - **Analytical**: Relies on logic, facts, analysis; takes time; needs information
  - **Intuitive**: Relies on gut feeling; makes decisions quickly; trusts instincts
  - **Balanced**: Uses both logic and intuition; moderate speed; flexible
  - **Cautious**: Needs lots of information; avoids risks; takes time
  - **Quick**: Makes decisions fast; comfortable with risks; trusts gut

### 6.4 Results Structure

**Headline insight** (one sentence):
- **Analytical**: "You make decisions with careful thought and analysis—this is a strength, and there are times to trust your gut too."
- **Intuitive**: "You trust your instincts when making decisions—this is powerful, and there are times when a bit of analysis helps."
- **Balanced**: "You balance logic and intuition in your decisions—this flexibility is a gift."
- **Cautious**: "You take your time with decisions and gather information—this helps you avoid mistakes, and there are times to trust yourself."
- **Quick**: "You make decisions quickly and trust your instincts—this helps you move fast, and there are times when slowing down helps."

**What we noticed** (2-3 insights):
1. **Your decision style**: "[Style description]. This is your natural approach, and it has strengths."
2. **What influences you**: "You're most influenced by [factor]. Knowing this can help you make decisions more confidently."
3. **When it works**: "Your style works really well when [situation]. This is something to lean into."

**What this means for you** (1-2 implications):
- **Decision-making**: "When making decisions, you might [pattern]. Understanding this can help you [benefit]."
- **Confidence**: "To feel more confident about decisions, you might try [strategy]."

**One thing to try** (single concrete action):
- "This week, try [specific action]. For example: [concrete example]."
- Examples:
  - **Analytical**: "Next time you're stuck analyzing, try asking 'What does my gut say?' and see what comes up."
  - **Intuitive**: "Next time you're about to decide quickly, try asking 'What's one thing I should consider?' and see if it changes anything."
  - **Balanced**: "Notice when you naturally balance logic and feeling—this is your strength."
  - **Cautious**: "Try making one small decision this week without overthinking it—see how it feels."
  - **Quick**: "Try slowing down for one decision this week—give yourself 24 hours—and see what you learn."

**Optional visual**:
- Simple diagram showing decision styles on a grid (logic vs. intuition, speed vs. deliberation)
- Or a visual showing their decision process

**Dive deeper options**:
- "Explore your full decision profile" (detailed breakdown)

## 7. Progressive Insight Implementation Notes

### 3.1 When to show insights

**During assessment:**
- Show insights after 3-4 questions if clear pattern emerges
- Use gentle language: "We're noticing..." / "Here's something interesting..."
- Don't force it—only show if pattern is clear enough
- Make it optional: "Want to keep going to learn more?"

**After assessment:**
- Always show headline insight immediately
- Reveal "What we noticed" progressively (fade in, one at a time)
- Show "What this means" after insights are revealed
- "One thing to try" appears last (action-oriented)

### 3.2 Language principles

- **Emotional, not clinical**: "You feel most alive when..." not "Your scores indicate..."
- **Personal, not generic**: Use "you" not "people like you" (mostly)
- **Validating**: "This is normal" / "This is valid" / "This is a strength"
- **Action-oriented**: Always include what they can do with the insight
- **Curious, not diagnostic**: "We noticed..." not "You have..."
